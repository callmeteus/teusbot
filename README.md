First and unique StreamCraft chat bot that integrates with StreamLabs.

# Disclaimer
This bot was closed source. Since StreamCraft is closing the doors, and will not use the code anymore, I'm releasing it for people that want to study how a Websocket chatbot works.
The bot code envolves a lot of reverse engineering from the StreamCraft original code.

# How to run it:
- Clone the source
- Install using `npm install`
- Define the required environment vars
  - **STREAMLABS_ID**: StreamLabs application ID
  - **STREAMLABS_SECRET**: StreamLabs application secret
- Run using `npm start`
